# parallel-alg
Projects from Parallel Algorithms course (Python)

###### Project 1 (Project1_1 and Project1_2) - Parallel implementation of Game of Life.
###### Project 2 (Projekat2_1, Projekat2_2, Projekat2_3) - Using PyCuda environment write a CUDA program for matrix multiplication.
###### 2_1 - Program that performs multiplications of small matrices (multiplication can be performed using a single block of threads)
###### 2_2 - Program that multiplies matrices of larger dimensions, using a larger number of CUDA blocks.
###### 2_3 - Accelerate the solution from 2_2 by using shared memory (so that the threads of one block first drag part of the data into the shared memory, and then read everything from the shared memory)
